Accepted options:
--bfile /data/trainN4k
--extract /data/metaExtract.txt
--make-grm-bin
--out /results/execution_benchmarks/xpblup/docker/xpblup_small

Note: This is a multi-thread program. You could specify the number of threads by the --thread-num option to speed up the computation if there are multiple processors in your machine.

Reading PLINK FAM file from [/data/trainN4k.fam].
4000 individuals to be included from [/data/trainN4k.fam].
Reading PLINK BIM file from [/data/trainN4k.bim].
18000 SNPs to be included from [/data/trainN4k.bim].
Reading a list of SNPs from [/data/metaExtract.txt].
3583 SNPs are extracted from [/data/metaExtract.txt].
Reading PLINK BED file from [/data/trainN4k.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 4000 individuals and 3583 SNPs to be included from [/data/trainN4k.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Recoding genotypes (individual major mode) ...

Calculating the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) ... (Note: default speed-optimized mode, may use huge RAM)

Summary of the GRM:
Mean of diagonals = 1.00045
Variance of diagonals = 0.0030353
Mean of off-diagonals = -0.000250172
Variance of off-diagonals = 0.000982539
GRM of 4000 individuals has been saved in the file [/results/execution_benchmarks/xpblup/docker/xpblup_small.grm.bin] (in binary format).
Number of SNPs to calculate the genetic relationship between each pair of individuals has been saved in the file [/results/execution_benchmarks/xpblup/docker/xpblup_small.grm.N.bin] (in binary format).
IDs for the GRM file [/results/execution_benchmarks/xpblup/docker/xpblup_small.grm.bin] have been saved in the file [/results/execution_benchmarks/xpblup/docker/xpblup_small.grm.id].
